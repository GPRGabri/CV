                    <p>My job/role here was supporting the Galp project, where customers placed their orders and the Team Manager managed them. The order was delivered in the form of a &quot;ticket&quot; and the analysis process began. The analysis process went through understanding the requirements, talking to the client if necessary to align the ideas of the requests and finally planning the execution where I was always present, all the steps from the analysis to the deploy.</p>
                    <p>Here I worked with <a href="https://www.dnnsoftware.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a>, which is a web content management system and full-stack role web application framework written in C#.</p>
                    <p>What did I do? I made some new features, new Forms, updates to HTML and CSS files like adapt some CSS for web and phone, JavaScript, some Angular and documented in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence"target="_blank">Confluence</a> all my tickets.</p> </td>
